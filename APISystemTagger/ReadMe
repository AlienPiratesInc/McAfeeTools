APISystemTagger.exe
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is the main application and contains two forms.

	MainForm 
	***********************************************************************************************************
	This form is where you apply and clear tags from.  By selecting a tag in the dropdown box and clicking the
	get system button, you will retrieve all systmes that have been assigned that tag.  NOTE:  it will append 
	the list to the textbox, it is advised to clear the text area before using this feature.

	Verify tagging Action - If this option is checked, the application will attempt to verify the tagging action 
	was successful for each of the systems in the textbox.  Once the tagging action is finished, a list of all 
	systems with the specified tag is retrieved.  Each system in the text box is compared against this retrieve 
	list.  If the action was successful the font is colored green, if it failed the font will be colored red.

	Login(Connection)
	***********************************************************************************************************
	You MUST set connection information prior to using any of the functionality on the main form.  You can set 
	the account and password used to connect to your ePO server.  The Server:Port area is where you enter the ePo
	server name/ip and port information.  Default port on ePO servers is 8443.  Note:  Please see the Servers.xml 
	document below.
	
mEpoApi.dll
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This DLL contains the methods and properties used to interact with the ePO API.  There are many features that 
	are not used in the Tagging application but have been created for use in other utilities.
	
Servers.xml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is where you can add a list of all server/port combinations.  Once added this selections will show up on 
	the Login form.  To add an entry you create a <server></server> Tag within the servers entity.  A sample one 
	exist as a demo and should be edited to included the correct info.
